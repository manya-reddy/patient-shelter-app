Problem statement / Context-
● Covid-19 is a disease that occurred in 2019 and has shaken up the world’s economy, prevalent to even today! Numerous myriads of people are vaccinated but nonetheless, healthcare facilities are still not efficient enough to cover all areas of the world.
● Due to covid-19, the world has suffered great loss of people in the past 3 years (2019-2022)
● Total cases being 685M, reports show 6.65M positive cases.
 Death rate from 2020-2022

Measures taken-
● The federal government of all countries of the world are keeping up with high vaccination rates.
● On the other hand, the government is ensuring safety measures by improving vaccinated datasets and feedback of public in order to boycott coronavirus.
● Technology has always played a major hand in establishing a society to demolish global problems. In this case, creating healthcare applications to stay alerted on the requirements
 and necessities of the people is very helpful to the authorities to stay up to date with the drugs quantities.

Our approach to the problem-
● By creating a platform called “Patient- shelter application”
● We look forward to help the government by giving our collective inputs of data required for covid-19.
● Patient Shelter application creates a common ground for various institutions involved in the drug distribution and utilisation systems.
● Thus, having a technological support to eliminate the prevalent virus that has disrupted mankind since 3 years, we hope to help the world for the benefit of people by ensuring their health
