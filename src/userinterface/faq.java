Based on research, it is likely that COVID-19 vaccines will prevent people from getting and spreading the virus.\nBoth the Pfizer-BioNtech and Moderna vaccines are showing about 95 percent efficacy in their preliminary reviews. \nThis means people who received these vaccines in clinical trials had a 95 percent lower risk of getting COVID than people in the \ntrial’s control group who did not receive a vaccine. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine showed 72 percent efficacy in U.S. clinical trials.\nThe clinical trials showed that all three vaccines were 100 percent effective at preventing hospitalizations and deaths from COVID.\n\nQ. How will we know if the COVID vaccines are safe and effective?\nAns. The research shows that the vaccines are safe and effective.\n\nQ. Is it possible to achieve immunity without a vaccine?\nAns. We think that having COVID-19 may protect you from getting it again, but we are unsure for how long. \nSome patients have had COVID more than once. It is recommended that people who have had COVID still get the vaccine.\n\nQ. How long will a vaccine protect people?\nAns. The length of time that the vaccine's protection lasts is being researched. The FDA and CDC are recommending \nbooster shots for certain people due to concerns that the effectiveness of the vaccine may decrease over time and may not \nprotect against a new strain of the virus.\n\nQ. Can someone get COVID from the vaccines?\nAns. It is impossible for the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna or Johnson & Johnson vaccines to give you COVID-19. \nNone of the vaccines contain any live virus. Vaccines prime your immune system to recognize and fight off a disease, \nbut they don’t actually cause an infection.\n\nQ. Can Long COVID be prevented or treated by COVID-19 vaccination?\nAns. Both older and more recent studies suggest that the risk of developing “Long COVID” after \nvaccine breakthrough infections is much lower than in unvaccinated people who get COVID-19.\n\nQ. Can the COVID-19 vaccines be given to people who are pregnant?\nAns. Evidence continues to build showing that COVID-19 vaccination before and during pregnancy is safe, \neffective, and beneficial to both the pregnant person and the baby. \n\nQ. How Long Are You Contagious With COVID-19?\nAns. On average, people are contagious for 5 to 10 days. But some people are contagious for longer periods. ");
